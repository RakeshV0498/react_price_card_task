# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Overview

The goal of this project is to gain proficiency in React development by building a small app that demonstrates key concepts such as component composition, state management, and conditional rendering. The app will consist of several components that interact with each other to create a simple user interface.

Features

Component-based Architecture: The app is structured into modular components, each responsible for a specific piece of functionality.

State Management with useState: Component state is managed using the useState hook to track changes and trigger re-renders as needed.

Conditional Rendering: Components render different content based on certain conditions or the component's state.

Reusable Components: Components are designed to be reusable and composable, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

Efficient Rendering: Utilizes React's virtual DOM to efficiently update and render UI components for optimal performance.
